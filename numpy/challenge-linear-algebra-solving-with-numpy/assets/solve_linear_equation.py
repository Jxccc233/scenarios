    Solves the linear equation Ax = b using matrix inversion.
    If the matrix A is not invertible or the dimensions of A and b do not match,
    raises a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

    Args:
        A: A NumPy matrix representing the coefficients of the linear equation.
        b: A NumPy matrix representing the constants of the linear equation.

    Returns:
        The solution to the linear equation Ax = b as a NumPy array.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the matrix A is not invertible or the dimensions of A and b do not match.
